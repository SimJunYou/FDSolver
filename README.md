# FDSolver

Trying to make a functional dependency solver after learning about them in CS2102.
The goal is to make it a fully featured library, though it might take some time.

## Features

Current feature wishlist:
- Full-featured Relation, FD, and FDSet (list of FDs) classes with pythonic operators implemented
- Basic functionality like decomposition, checking for triviality, etc.
- Advanced functionality like closures, keys, prime attributes.
- Solver functions like checking whether a relation is in BCNF, finding lossless-join BCNF decompositions, finding minimal bases, etc.

## Tests

Some basic testing implemented in the `tests` directory. To be expanded on.
